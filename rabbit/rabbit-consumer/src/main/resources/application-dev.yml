A value of 0 means leak detection is disabled, minimum accepted value is 2000 (ms). ( ps: it's rarely needed option, use only for debugging ), default: 0
      max-lifetime: 1800000               # This property controls the maximum lifetime of a connection in the pool. A value of 0 indicates no maximum lifetime (infinite lifetime), default: 1800000

      validation-timeout: 5000            # This property controls the maximum amount of time that a connection will be tested for aliveness. This value must be less than the :connection-timeout. The lowest accepted validation timeout is 1000ms (1 second)
